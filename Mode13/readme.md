#Running

This needs real-mode DOS to run, and once running it will prompt you for the dimensions of the image to render (maximum 320x200) and the sample count to render it at (1 sample = 4 samples per pixel)

Included here is a Bochs virtual PC image which boots directly into smallpt.com and renders very very slowly directly to the screen.
